"""
Basic HTTP Stress Test Tool (Dos attack)
----------------------------
This script performs a basic stress test on a given server by sending multiple 
concurrent HTTP GET requests using threading.
Hereâ€™s the corrected sentence:
Since all requests originate from a single IP address, this falls under the category of a DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack,
rather than a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack.

Features:
- Sends a large number of HTTP GET requests to a specified target.
- Uses multiple threads to generate concurrent requests.
- Handles request failures and timeouts gracefully.
- Can be used to test the response behavior of a web server.

How to Use:
0. The target should be specified as a full URL, including protocol and port if needed:
   
   Example: python3 ./dos_attack.py {server_ip}
