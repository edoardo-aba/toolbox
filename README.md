# Cybersecurity Scripts Collection

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python scripts I've developed during my cybersecurity journey. These scripts cover various aspects of cybersecurity, including domain validation and network security testing. They serve as both practical tools and learning resources for understanding different cybersecurity concepts.

## Scripts

### check_domains_validity.py
This script checks the validity of a list of domains. It verifies if the domains are active and properly configured. This can be useful for network administrators or security professionals who need to validate domain configurations.

### dos_attack.py
This script simulates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only, to help understand how such attacks work and how to defend against them. Please use this script responsibly and only in controlled environments with proper authorization.

### gobuster_clone.py
This script simulates a directory enumeration tool similar to Gobuster. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only, to help identify accessible or hidden web pages and directories on a target server. This script can assist in understanding how attackers discover vulnerable resources and how to secure them. Please use this script responsibly and only on domains you have permission to test.

### cmd.php
php script that only prints the system id, use it to test, if the uploading file works fine, and the machine consumes it

### rvsh.php
reverse php shell that allows the attacker to gain connection over the machine, first: nc -lvpn <port> on your machine, then run the script on the target machine and get the reverse shell

### Soon others will come
