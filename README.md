# Cybersecurity Scripts Collection

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python scripts I've developed during my cybersecurity journey. These scripts cover various aspects of cybersecurity, including domain validation and network security testing. They serve as both practical tools and learning resources for understanding different cybersecurity concepts.

## Scripts

### check_domains_validity.py
This script checks the validity of a list of domains. It verifies if the domains are active and properly configured. This can be useful for network administrators or security professionals who need to validate domain configurations.

### dos_attack.py
This script simulates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only, to help understand how such attacks work and how to defend against them. Please use this script responsibly and only in controlled environments with proper authorization.
